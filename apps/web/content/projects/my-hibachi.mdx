## Project Overview

My Hibachi LLC is a comprehensive booking platform that enables customers to book hibachi catering services with a seamless, mobile-first experience. The platform features a responsive Next.js frontend deployed on Vercel and a robust FastAPI backend running on VPS infrastructure.

## Key Features

### Frontend (Next.js/TypeScript)
- **Mobile-first responsive design** with Tailwind CSS
- **Server-side rendering** for optimal SEO and performance
- **Form validation** with Zod for type-safe data handling
- **Real-time booking availability** with optimistic updates
- **Accessible UI components** following WCAG guidelines

### Backend (FastAPI/Postgres)
- **RESTful API** with comprehensive OpenAPI documentation
- **JWT authentication** with role-based access control
- **Database migrations** with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Comprehensive logging** and error handling

### DevOps & Deployment
- **CI/CD pipeline** with GitHub Actions
- **Automated testing** (unit + integration tests)
- **Environment management** (dev/staging/prod)
- **Database backups** and monitoring

## Technical Challenges

### Challenge 1: Real-time Booking Conflicts
**Problem**: Multiple users booking the same time slot simultaneously.

**Solution**: Implemented optimistic locking with database constraints and real-time conflict detection:

```python
# FastAPI route with conflict detection
@router.post("/bookings")
async def create_booking(booking: BookingCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    # Check availability with row-level locking
    existing = db.query(Booking).filter(
        Booking.date == booking.date,
        Booking.time_slot == booking.time_slot
    ).with_for_update().first()
    
    if existing:
        raise HTTPException(409, "Time slot no longer available")
    
    return create_booking_record(db, booking)
```

### Challenge 2: Mobile Performance
**Problem**: Slow loading on mobile devices with limited bandwidth.

**Solution**: Implemented progressive loading and optimizations:

```typescript
// Next.js with progressive enhancement
const BookingForm = dynamic(() => import('./BookingForm'), {
  loading: () => <BookingSkeleton />,
  ssr: false // Load after hydration for better perceived performance
});

// Image optimization with Next.js
<Image
  src="/images/hibachi-setup.jpg"
  alt="Hibachi setup"
  width={800}
  height={600}
  priority={false}
  placeholder="blur"
  blurDataURL="data:image/jpeg;base64,..."
/>
```

### Challenge 3: Secure Authentication
**Problem**: Protecting user data and preventing unauthorized access.

**Solution**: JWT tokens with refresh rotation and CORS configuration:

```python
# Security middleware
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["https://my-hibachi.vercel.app"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

# JWT with automatic refresh
def create_access_token(data: dict, expires_delta: timedelta = None):
    to_encode = data.copy()
    expire = datetime.utcnow() + (expires_delta or timedelta(minutes=15))
    to_encode.update({"exp": expire})
    return jwt.encode(to_encode, SECRET_KEY, algorithm=ALGORITHM)
```

## Results & Impact

### Business Metrics
- **100% self-serve bookings** - eliminated manual booking coordination
- **25% reduction in user-visible errors** through comprehensive validation
- **40% faster release cycles** with automated CI/CD

### Technical Metrics
- **< 2s page load time** on mobile devices
- **99.9% uptime** with automated health checks
- **Zero security incidents** with comprehensive auth and validation

### User Experience
- **Mobile-first design** that works seamlessly across devices
- **Intuitive booking flow** with real-time feedback
- **Accessible interface** tested with screen readers

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Next.js + FastAPI?
- **Next.js**: Server-side rendering for SEO, great developer experience
- **FastAPI**: Automatic OpenAPI docs, excellent performance, type safety
- **Separation of concerns**: Frontend and backend can scale independently

### Why Postgres?
- **ACID compliance** for booking consistency
- **Rich data types** for complex queries
- **Mature ecosystem** with excellent tooling

### Why Vercel + VPS?
- **Vercel**: Zero-config deployments, excellent Next.js integration
- **VPS**: Full control over backend infrastructure and databases

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with user experience** - mobile-first design prevented major refactoring
2. **Invest in CI/CD early** - automated deployments paid dividends immediately
3. **Validation everywhere** - client + server validation caught edge cases
4. **Monitor real users** - analytics revealed usage patterns we didn't expect

## Next Steps

- **Analytics dashboard** for booking trends and revenue tracking
- **Email notifications** for booking confirmations and reminders
- **Payment integration** with Stripe for seamless transactions
- **Customer reviews** and rating system
