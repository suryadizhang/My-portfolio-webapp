# Placeholder Images Setup

Since this is a development setup, you'll need to add your own images in the following locations:

## Required Images:

### Personal Photos:
- `/public/images/headshot.jpg` - Professional headshot for the about page (recommended: 600x600px)

### Project Screenshots:
- `/public/images/projects/booking-platform.jpg` - AI booking platform screenshot
- `/public/images/projects/analytics-dashboard.jpg` - Analytics dashboard screenshot  
- `/public/images/projects/task-management.jpg` - Task management PWA screenshot

### Resume:
- `/public/resume.pdf` - Your actual resume PDF

## Image Guidelines:

**Project Screenshots:**
- Recommended size: 1200x800px (3:2 aspect ratio)
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Show the actual application interface
- High quality, professional appearance

**Headshot:**
- Recommended size: 600x600px (square)
- Professional but approachable
- Good lighting and high quality

**Resume PDF:**
- Keep file size under 2MB for web performance
- Professional formatting
- Up-to-date information

## Placeholder Setup:

For development, you can use placeholder images:
1. Create simple colored rectangles as placeholders
2. Use services like https://via.placeholder.com/
3. Replace with real images before deployment

Example placeholder URLs:
- Headshot: https://via.placeholder.com/600x600/4F46E5/FFFFFF?text=Your+Photo
- Project: https://via.placeholder.com/1200x800/10B981/FFFFFF?text=Project+Screenshot
